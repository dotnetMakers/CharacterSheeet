# dotNetMakers Character Sheeet

A digital display for your RPG character needs.

Basically we're building a 2-part "thing".  First is a display tablet, second is a phone app.  The phone app is the "input" device for the tablet and pairs over bluetooth

## Display

This is a battery-powered e-paper display with a 5-way joystick input.  This sits on teh table next to you for easy at-a-glance reference of your character's stats, equipment, spells, and other sheeet.

[Bill of Materials is here](Docs/bom.md).

## Phone app

This app stores your character details and provides the ability to update things that change, like hit points, luck, whatever.

## Goals

- Low-cost BOM
- printable enclosure
- off-the-shelf hardware (i.e. anyone can buy the parts and make it)
- > 4 hours battery life (preferrably way more) for the tablet

v1 will be a 2-color display (black and white).  We'll look at more colors later.  Bear in mind, more colors on e-paper means slower (much slower) refresh time.
